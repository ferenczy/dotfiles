dotfiles
========

My configuration files for various *nix tools. Used in [Debian](http://www.debian.org), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org) and [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).

This repository contains only configuration files, so it won't work on its own. It's good rather as inspiration.


zsh
---

Zsh configuration expects, that you have [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) installed in directory `~/.oh-my-zsh`.


vim
---

Vim configuration is based on [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) plugin manager, which should be located in directory `~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`.


prompt
------

The one thing useful for others and also easily portable could be the prompt. You can see how it looks bellow:
